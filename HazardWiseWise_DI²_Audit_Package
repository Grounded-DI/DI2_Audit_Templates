Attestation

This package memorializes a point-in-time audit state of HazardWise DI² as of the date above.
Artifacts herein are deterministic, static, and non-mutable. This package documents system integrity and determinism only and does not constitute forecasting, emergency guidance, legal advice, operational instruction, or authorization to act.

PAGE 1 — INTERACTIVE AUDIT SURFACE

Audit Dimension:

Human Interrogability

Statement

HazardWise outputs are interrogable through direct questioning without loss of determinism.

Permitted Audit Actions

• Follow-up questioning
• Issue isolation
• Counterfactual testing
• Parameter substitution (within audited bounds)
• Procedural posture variation

Determinism Guarantee

Identical inputs yield identical outputs under identical system state.

Clarification

All permitted audit actions occur within a fixed deterministic state and do not modify system logic, stored outputs, or audit artifacts.

Exclusions

• No probabilistic variance
• No hidden adaptive learning
• No post-hoc rewriting

Vault Status

STABLE / ___

Certification Statement

The audited system state conforms to enforced scroll governance and integrity thresholds within the defined scope.

PAGE 4 — DOCTRINE / ASSESSMENT EXHIBIT INDEX

Audit Dimension:

Deterministic Traceability

Assessment Domains Covered

• Deterministic index computation
• Threshold-based escalation logic
• Corridor-bounded parameter analysis
• Output constraint enforcement

Assessment Exhibits

HazardWise generates and retains assessment maps that:
• identify evaluated indices and parameters,
• apply fixed thresholds and dominance rules,
• constrain narrative outputs to deterministic structures.

Conformance Rule

All narrative outputs must conform to their corresponding assessment exhibits.

Exhibit Retention

Assessment exhibits are preserved as audit artifacts.

PAGE 5 — FORMULA FUNCTION LEDGER

Audit Dimension:

Foundational Integrity Controls

These formulas exist solely to enforce integrity constraints and audit boundaries, not to generate forecasts, alerts, or operational hazard directives.

Formula Disclosure Level

Functional Reference Only

Referenced Integrity Formulas (License- and Context-Scoped)

Total Active Formulas in Scope: ___

Formula Activation Summary (Audited Scope)

Formula ID	Status	Notes
___	___	___
___	___	___

Non-triggered formulas remain active, armed, and enforceable; non-activation indicates absence of breach conditions, not absence of control.

Disclosure Note
Mathematical expressions are unnecessary for audit verification and intentionally excluded.

(OPTIONAL) PAGE 6 — DI PRINCIPLES REFERENCED

Principle 91
Ethical and cognitive integrity constraint.

Principle 106
Authorship and attribution integrity.

Principle 138
Citation and probability sealing.

Constraint Status
All principles enforced and non-overrideable.

⸻

🔒 SEALING RULE

Once assembled:
• export to PDF
• compute hash
• store immutably
• never revise in place

New audit state = new package.
