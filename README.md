# DI2_Audit_Templates
Canonical audit templates for DI² systems. This repository contains non-executable, domain-scoped audit artifacts documenting deterministic integrity, governance posture, and sealing rules across Grounded DI domains (e.g., BriefWise, CleanWaterWise). Inspection only; no runtime logic.

# BriefWise DI² — Audit Package

This repository contains a **deterministic audit artifact** for BriefWise DI² operating under Grounded DI OS — System 2.

The contents document **audit integrity only**.  
They do not provide a model, service, API, or executable system.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A memorialized **Tier-15 Passive Integrity audit package**
- A point-in-time record of system determinism and constraint enforcement
- An inspection artifact for due diligence, governance, or compliance review

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a model
- Not an API
- Not a runtime system
- Not legal advice
- Not operational instruction
- Not authorization to act

No outputs are generated from this repository.

## System Context

- **System:** Grounded DI OS — System 2  
- **Module:** BriefWise DI²  
- **Mode:** DI² FastPath 4.1  
- **Tier:** 15 — Passive Integrity  
- **Entropy Lock:** ΔH = 0.0042  
- **DI Principles Field:** 0–159 (audit / trace active)

---

## Audit Posture

- Passive integrity monitoring only
- No adaptive behavior
- No probabilistic processing
- No background execution
- Deterministic, clause-locked evaluation

All integrity controls are **armed but dormant** and activate only upon breach.

---

## Repository Contents

- **Audit Package (PDF)**  
  Canonical sealed audit artifact

- **Hash Record**  
  SHA-256 digest for integrity verification

- **Metadata (Non-Executable)**  
  Scope, counts, and audit context only

---

## Immutability Rule

Once issued:
- the audit package is sealed,
- hashed,
- and never revised.

Any update produces a **new package**.
