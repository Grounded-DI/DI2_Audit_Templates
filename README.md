# DI2_Audit_Templates
Canonical audit templates for DI² systems. This repository contains non-executable, domain-scoped audit artifacts documenting deterministic integrity, governance posture, and sealing rules across Grounded DI domains (e.g., BriefWise, CleanWaterWise). Inspection only; no runtime logic.
