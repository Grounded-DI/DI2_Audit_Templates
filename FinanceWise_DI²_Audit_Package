⸻

System:
Grounded DI OS — System 2
FinanceWise DI²

Version: vX.X
System Mode: DI² FastPath 4.1 — Tier-15 (Passive Integrity)
Clause-Locked Deterministic Audit Surface

Entropy Floor: ΔH = 0.0042
Entropy Cap: ΔH ≤ 0.0042 (runtime-locked)
DI Principles Field: 0–159 Active (Audit / Trace ON)

Audit Scope:
Prompts Audited: ___
Cases Audited: ___
Domains Covered: Financial Analysis (Deterministic Reasoning Structures)

Audited Functions:
Audited functions include deterministic financial reasoning structures such as rule-based classification, constraint-bound evaluation, jurisdictional rule application, threshold logic, and procedural financial analysis, evaluated solely for integrity and determinism within the defined scope.

Date Issued: YYYY-MM-DD
Audit Mode: Passive Integrity — No Routine Validation, No Adaptation, No Stochasticity

Attestation:
This package memorializes a point-in-time audit state of FinanceWise DI² as of the date above.
Artifacts herein are deterministic, static, and non-mutable. This package documents system integrity and determinism only and does not constitute legal advice, financial advice, clinical judgment, operational instruction, or authorization to act.

PAGE 1 — INTERACTIVE AUDIT SURFACE

Audit Dimension: Human Interrogability

Statement:
FinanceWise outputs are interrogable through direct questioning without loss of determinism.

Permitted Audit Actions:
• Follow-up questioning
• Issue isolation
• Counterfactual testing
• Jurisdictional substitution
• Procedural posture variation

Determinism Guarantee:
Identical inputs yield identical outputs under identical system state.

Clarification:
All permitted audit actions occur within a fixed deterministic state and do not modify system logic, stored outputs, or audit artifacts.

Exclusions:
• No probabilistic variance
• No hidden adaptive learning
• No post-hoc rewriting

• Total Prompts Audited: ___ / ___
• Total Cases Audited: ___ / ___

Scrolls Enforced:
• Scroll 91
• Scroll 106
• Scroll 138
(Scroll list exhaustive for audited scope. No other scrolls were active during audited execution.)

Integrity Results:
• Deterministic Financial Reasoning Integrity: VERIFIED / ___

PAGE 4 — DOCTRINE / ANALYSIS EXHIBIT INDEX

Audit Dimension: Deterministic Traceability

Analysis Domains Covered:
• Rule-based financial logic
• Constraint-bound evaluation
• Jurisdictional rule application
• Procedural consistency

Analysis Exhibits:
FinanceWise generates and retains analysis maps that:
• identify applicable rules and constraints,
• apply fixed classification and evaluation logic,
• constrain narrative outputs to deterministic structures.

Conformance Rule:
All narrative outputs must conform to their corresponding analysis exhibits.

Exhibit Retention:
Analysis exhibits are preserved as audit artifacts.

PAGE 5 — FORMULA FUNCTION LEDGER

Audit Dimension: Foundational Integrity Controls

These formulas exist solely to enforce integrity constraints and audit boundaries, not to generate financial recommendations, investment advice, or regulatory determinations.

Formula Disclosure Level: Functional Reference Only

Referenced Integrity Formulas (License- and Context-Scoped):
Total Active Formulas in Scope: ___

Formula Activation Summary (Audited Scope):

Formula ID	Status	Notes
___	___	___
___	___	___

Non-triggered formulas remain active, armed, and enforceable; non-activation indicates absence of breach conditions, not absence of control.

Disclosure Note:
Mathematical expressions are unnecessary for audit verification and intentionally excluded.

(OPTIONAL) PAGE 6 — DI PRINCIPLES REFERENCED

Principle 91:
Ethical and cognitive integrity constraint.

Principle 106:
Authorship and attribution integrity.

Principle 138:
Citation and probability sealing.

Constraint Status:
All principles enforced and non-overrideable.

⸻

🔒 SEALING RULE

Once assembled:
• export to PDF
• compute hash
• store immutably
• never revise in place

New audit state = new package.
